# Newspaper-Prediction-Project
Linear Regression predicts outcomes based on the relationship between a dependent variable (e.g., Sunday newspaper sales) and oneindependent variables. It uses a linear equation to model this relationship and estimates coefficients to determine the impact of each predictor on the target variable.
